##  How to use Python and PySpark 3.0.1 for Data Engineering

The Python Spark project including:

### Sales Data
```list
1. Create a Spark Session

2. Read a CSV file into a Spark Dataframe

3. Learn to Infer a Schema

4. Select data from the Spark Dataframe

5. Produce analytics that shows the topmost sales orders per Region and Country
```




### Convert Fahrenheit to Degrees Centigrade
```
1. Create a Spark Session

2. Read and Parallelize data using the Spark Context into an RDD

3. Create a Function to Convert Fahrenheit to Degrees Centigrade

4. Use the Map Function to convert data contained within an RDD

5. Filter temperatures greater than or equal to 13 degrees celsius
```




### XYZ Research

```
1. Create a set of RDDs that hold Research Data

2. Use the union transformation to combine RDDs

3. Learn to use the subtract transformation to minus values from an RDD

4. Use the RDD API to answer the following questions

5. How many research projects were initiated in the first three years?

6. How many projects were completed in the first year?

7. How many projects were completed in the first two years?
```

### Sales Analytics

```
1. Create the Sales Analytics DataFrame to a set of CSV Files

2. Prepare the DataFrame by applying a Structure

3. Remove bad records from the DataFrame (Cleaning)

4. Generate New Columns from the DataFrame

5. Write a Partitioned DataFrame to a Parquet Directory

6. Answer the following questions and create visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib

        * What was the best month in sales?

        * What city sold the most products?

        * What time should the business display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers buying products?
